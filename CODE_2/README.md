# This project is a part of a Bachelor's thesis 'Feature engineering for machine learning predictions in atmospheric science' and is based on the previous work of Lumiaro et al. (2021) https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-13227-2021 and parts of the source code are used from the publication. 
# Data for this project is originally sourced from Wang et al. (2017) https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-7529-2017
# The aim of this project is to improve the performance and accuracy of the original source code that applies machine learning methods on the data set sourced from Wang et al. (2017)
# This project is guided and supervised by Prof. Patrick Rinke and Dr. Hilda Sandstr√∂m from Aalto University, Department of Applied Physics, CEST group
# Usage of code: run_main.py to run a single script
# run_main_allmodels.py runs everything 
# All data files are stored in 'data' folder
# All model python scripts are stored in 'model_scripts' folder and are accessible as an importable package.
# funs.py stores auxiliary functions for run_main.py
# testing.py is for various sanity checks and may be ignored
