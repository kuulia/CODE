# This project is a part of a Bachelor's thesis 'Feature engineering for machine learning predictions in atmospheric science' and is based on the previous work of Lumiaro et al. (2021) and parts of the source code are used from the publication. The aim is to improve the performance and accuracy of the original source code.
# This project is guided and supervised by Prof. Patrick Rinke and Dr. Hilda Sandstr√∂m from Aalto university Department of Applied Physics CEST group
# usage of code: run_main.py
# All data files are stored in 'data' folder
# All model python scripts are stored in 'model_scripts' folder
# 'main' folder contains run_main.py and auxiliary scripts for running run_main.py
